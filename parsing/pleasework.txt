<text start="0" dur="2.12">Hey, this is kinda like a part two video</text>
<text start="2.18" dur="2">
I mean you don&#39;t have to have seen the part one video
</text>
<text start="4.18" dur="2.34">to understand what I talk about in this video,</text>
<text start="6.52" dur="3.06">
But I mean if you haven&#39;t watched part one, uh, you should.
</text>
<text start="9.58" dur="2.38">So I used to work at Subway and to be honest about</text>
<text start="11.96" dur="2.48">80% of the customers were fine.</text>
<text start="14.44" dur="3.04">
Sometimes they would do something that would just personally annoy me,
</text>
<text start="17.48" dur="2.02">like ask for a meatball on flatbread.</text>
<text start="19.5" dur="1.76">So don&#39;t feel too bad for me.</text>
<text start="21.26" dur="1.44">Like, sometimes people would ask me:</text>
<text start="22.7" dur="2.8">
&quot;Can I have a turkey with lettuce, tomatoes--&quot;
</text>
<text start="25.5" dur="1.34">Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Slow down!</text>
<text start="26.84" dur="1.4">What kind of bread? Foot-long or six-inch?</text>
<text start="28.24" dur="1.5">What kind of cheese? Is it toasted?</text>
<text start="29.74" dur="1.72">THEN we&#39;ll talk about vegetables!</text>
<text start="31.46" dur="1.48">And every time someone brought in a list,</text>
<text start="32.94" dur="1.74">there would always be something missing on it.</text>
<text start="34.68" dur="0.5">Always!</text>
<text start="35.18" dur="2.6">I never had someone come in with a complete list.</text>
<text start="37.78" dur="1.78">
I would ask someone, &quot;What kind of cheese?&quot;
</text>
<text start="39.56" dur="2.4">
And they would say, &quot;Agh, they didn&#39;t specify.&quot;
</text>
<text start="41.96" dur="2.88">
Well then, if they didn&#39;t care enough to remember cheese, I guess they&#39;ll get swiss!
</text>
<text start="44.84" dur="4.32">
If anyone watching is currently working at a Subway, then feel free to use these tricks.
</text>
<text start="49.16" dur="1.02">if someone asked me,</text>
<text start="50.18" dur="2.32">
&quot;Hmm, what kind of cheese do you recommend?&quot;
</text>
<text start="52.5" dur="1.88">I would ALWAYS say provolone.</text>
<text start="54.38" dur="2.64">
because it&#39;s the easiest cheese to pull apart with gloves on.
</text>
<text start="57.02" dur="4.48">
Really, if anyone asked me what I recommended, I would just tell them the easiest thing for me to do.
</text>
<text start="61.5" dur="3.56">
But even after I gave my insightful provolone cheese recommendation,
</text>
<text start="65.06" dur="1.6">Sometimes people would still say,</text>
<text start="66.66" dur="2.04">&quot;Hmm, I&#39;ll take American.&quot;</text>
<text start="68.7" dur="3.68">
why do you even ask me what cheese I would recommend if you&#39;re not gonna take it seriously?!
</text>
<text start="72.38" dur="3.76">
Another thing that would annoy me is when people would say the sandwich was &quot;All done&quot;
</text>
<text start="76.14" dur="1.72">But they didn&#39;t put any sauce on it.</text>
<text start="77.86" dur="3.22">
So I would ask, &quot;Any sauce?&quot; and then they would be like, &quot;Oh yeah, Mayonnaise.&quot;
</text>
<text start="81.08" dur="2.64">
OH! Why did you tell me it was all done IF IT WASN&#39;T!
</text>
<text start="83.72" dur="3.8">
Also, the receipt machine at the store took like seven seconds to print out the receipt.
</text>
<text start="87.52" dur="3.88">
So it would be very awkward if I asked someone, &quot;Do you want your receipt?&quot;
</text>
<text start="91.4" dur="1.04">and then they would say, &quot;Yes.&quot;</text>
<text start="92.44" dur="1.64">And then we would just STARE...</text>
<text start="94.62" dur="1.02">AT EACH OTHER...</text>
<text start="96.14" dur="1">UNTIL...</text>
<text start="97.7" dur="0.7">The receipt printed.</text>
<text start="98.4" dur="2.72">
So what I did every time someone swiped their credit card,
</text>
<text start="101.12" dur="1.42">I would just stare off into space,</text>
<text start="102.54" dur="3.16">
And in my head, I would count to five and then I would ask,
</text>
<text start="105.7" dur="1.22">&quot;Do you want your receipt?&quot;</text>
<text start="106.92" dur="2.6">And by the time they said yes, it was like magic!</text>
<text start="109.52" dur="2.56">
As soon as they said yes, BSSHHH, the receipt printed.
</text>
<text start="112.08" dur="2.12">At Subway, you only work with one other person.</text>
<text start="114.2" dur="1.48">So if someone got annoyed and said,</text>
<text start="115.68" dur="1.32">&quot;Lemme talk to your manager.&quot;</text>
<text start="117" dur="3.38">
I would just look at them and go, &quot;Listen, I&#39;ve been here the longest.
</text>
<text start="120.38" dur="4.76">
The only other person in this store is a 16-year-old girl, and she technically isn&#39;t old enough to use the toaster.
</text>
<text start="125.14" dur="2.7">
So, I&#39;m probably your best bet. I&#39;m the manager.&quot;
</text>
<text start="127.84" dur="4.06">
Like, do people think the manager will automatically take their side and give them free stuff?
</text>
<text start="131.9" dur="2.82">
YES, actually they do think that because it happens all the time.
</text>
<text start="134.72" dur="4.54">
I would consider myself a pretty laid-back Subway employee. I didn&#39;t like to be stingy with people,
</text>
<text start="139.26" dur="2.76">
Even though I was disobeying the Subway formula on purpose.
</text>
<text start="142.02" dur="3.88">
Oh, you want more than six olives on your foot-long? Pff, sure!
</text>
<text start="145.9" dur="1.6">Here, have a FIFTH slice of cheese!</text>
<text start="147.5" dur="3.96">
A dollar fifty for avocado? Pff, I&#39;ll charge you seventy-five cents buddy!
</text>
<text start="151.46" dur="4.62">
I probably shouldn&#39;t be saying these things, you know. In case this whole YouTube thing flops and I need a job.
</text>
<text start="156.08" dur="4.1">
So I wasn&#39;t really &quot;strict&quot; on the rules. You know those fast food workers who are strict,
</text>
<text start="160.18" dur="2.62">
&quot;No! We won&#39;t serve breakfast at 10:02! Get out!&quot;
</text>
<text start="162.8" dur="3.08">
But being pretty laid back still didn&#39;t stop people from being annoying.
</text>
<text start="165.88" dur="3.7">
So this one person comes in and asks for two, foot-long, pastrami sandwiches.
</text>
<text start="169.58" dur="4.28">
And pastrami is our most expensive sandwich. It&#39;s about $10 for a foot-long.
</text>
<text start="173.86" dur="6.7">
And guys, the pastrami is super good, but I wouldn&#39;t pay for it. I mean it&#39;s good, yeah, but I&#39;m not paying $10 for a foot-long.
</text>
<text start="180.56" dur="4.72">
It&#39;s not worth it. So this guy, I make his two sandwiches. I ring them up and I say, &quot;That&#39;ll be $20.&quot;
</text>
<text start="185.28" dur="4.68">
And I guess he didn&#39;t look at the price of the sandwich on the menu, or he thought we still did the $5 foot-longs,
</text>
<text start="189.96" dur="2.04">
because he said to me, &quot;I ain&#39;t paying for that.&quot;
</text>
<text start="192" dur="1.84">And this is when I was just starting out!</text>
<text start="193.84" dur="4.06">
I only had like, a week of experience, and after he said that, I responded,
</text>
<text start="197.9" dur="3.78">
&quot;Well, shoot, I guess you&#39;re not paying for it, I didn&#39;t know people could do that.&quot;
</text>
<text start="201.68" dur="6.2">
&quot;Hey, I want this!&quot; &quot;Alright, that&#39;s $20&quot; &quot;Nah.&quot; &quot;You don&#39;t want it?&quot; &quot; No I want it, I&#39;m just not paying for it.&quot;
</text>
<text start="207.88" dur="6.36">
Ok no, but actually we did come up with a compromise. He told me he had $12, so he ended up paying for one of the sandwiches,
</text>
<text start="214.24" dur="2.72">
And I got to eat the other one. So it all worked out.
</text>
<text start="216.96" dur="5.4">
So one time I was making a sandwich for a guy with a very heavy accent and he asks for onions on the side.
</text>
<text start="222.36" dur="3.28">
No big deal! We had Sooubway put vegetables in little cups all the time.
</text>
<text start="225.64" dur="4.62">
I actually got a soup cup, because the on the side cups are teeny-tiny and I started doing my thing.
</text>
<text start="230.26" dur="8.04">
But then he says, &quot;No! On the side.&quot; and I think, &quot; Oh! He&#39;s getting a foot-long! He probably wants onions on half of it, but not the other.
</text>
<text start="238.3" dur="5.26">
So I start putting onions on half the sub, but then again he says, &quot;No! On the side!&quot;
</text>
<text start="243.56" dur="4.88">
At this point, I don&#39;t know what this guy wants. So I ask him, &quot;On the side of what?&quot; and then he screams,
</text>
<text start="248.44" dur="0.9">O N I O N S</text>
<text start="249.34" dur="1.9">And I never figured out what he was trying to say.</text>
<text start="251.24" dur="5.54">
This one old gentleman asks for sauce to be put on his vegetables, and normally we put it on top of the sandwich with the meat.
</text>
<text start="256.78" dur="4.6">
And I didn&#39;t know if I heard him correctly because I put the sauce on and closed the sandwich.
</text>
<text start="261.38" dur="2.14">
So your sauce would&#39;ve been in the same place either way!
</text>
<text start="263.52" dur="2.86">One time, this woman tipped me and Correy $40.</text>
<text start="266.38" dur="3.34">
She wasn&#39;t annoying. I just wanted to sprinkle in some good customer stories.
</text>
<text start="269.72" dur="6.32">
Ok one time, this, uh, Native American person came in and, I don&#39;t know if mentioning that was important to the story...
</text>
<text start="276.06" dur="5.28">
He comes in and asks for five foot-long Tunas. Ok Tyler, just me and you lets do this!
</text>
<text start="281.34" dur="3.34">
and then when we&#39;re all finished, we ring them up and we say, &quot;Anything else?&quot;
</text>
<text start="284.68" dur="4.3">
and he says, &quot;seven meatballs&quot; What!? He wanted seven more sandwiches!
</text>
<text start="288.98" dur="6.02">
But James, you&#39;re Sooubway! You&#39;re supposed to make people sandwiches regardless of how many they ask for.
</text>
<text start="295" dur="2.4">
Yeah I know, but the guy could&#39;ve handled it differently.
</text>
<text start="297.4" dur="4.68">
Normally for a platter, you have to call in at least an hour ahead, and that&#39;s only five foot-longs.
</text>
<text start="302.08" dur="5.46">
This guy could&#39;ve called ahead and said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m getting twelve sandwiches so just, prepare yourselves... mentally.&quot;
</text>
<text start="307.54" dur="5.08">
I mean we had so many customers waiting in line. No, we didn&#39;t that&#39;s a lie, it was only him. But still!
</text>
<text start="312.62" dur="3.7">
This one woman, I was making her sandwich and for vegetables, she asked for extra lettuce.
</text>
<text start="316.82" dur="5.84">
So I put on a big handful, but then she asks for more. So I put more on, &quot;more&quot; I sprinkle some on
</text>
<text start="322.84" dur="0.84">M O R E!</text>
<text start="323.68" dur="6.22">
&quot;Uh, I won&#39;t be able to close the sandwich with any more lettuce.&quot; and she says, &quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot; &quot;Alright, extra lettuce it is.&quot;
</text>
<text start="329.9" dur="3.3">
So I ended up giving her an open sandwich with a mountain of lettuce.
</text>
<text start="333.2" dur="1.86">You know we do salads, right?</text>
<text start="335.06" dur="5.72">
When I was little, I always thought if I was working at a store and someone tried to rob me, I wouldn&#39;t give them any money.
</text>
<text start="340.78" dur="5.18">
But now it&#39;s like, &quot;Pshh, I ain&#39;t risking my life for Sooubway! Here take the cash register!&quot;
</text>
<text start="345.96" dur="4.72">
So thankfully I&#39;ve never had someone pull a gun on me, but I have caught people stealing from us.
</text>
<text start="350.68" dur="3.72">
I was making someone&#39;s sandwich and this one kid asks for just a water cup.
</text>
<text start="354.4" dur="5.12">
So I gave it to him. So I go back to making a sandwich and I just hear the fuzzy soda sounds being dispensed,
</text>
<text start="359.52" dur="4.36">
And I look over, and the kid is putting soda in the cup! HE DIDN&#39;T EVEN TRY TO HIDE IT!
</text>
<text start="363.88" dur="3.88">
When I put soda in a water cup I at least wait for the employees to go in the back.
</text>
<text start="367.76" dur="3.5">
But, I didn&#39;t even say anything. I was just like, &quot;Alright, man.&quot;
</text>
<text start="371.26" dur="4.62">
This guy, I totally saw him take a bag of chips and he hid it under the counter so I couldn&#39;t see.
</text>
<text start="375.88" dur="4.36">
So when I rang up his sandwich I asked, &quot;Anything else?&quot; and he said, &quot;Nope.&quot;
</text>
<text start="380.24" dur="4.9">
Alright, whatever. Ok, last story. I was in the back playing some Clash of Clans,
</text>
<text start="385.14" dur="4.18">
And we have a computer that shows what the cameras see, and I see this woman who was eating there,
</text>
<text start="389.32" dur="4.94">
She reached over the counter and took three large cups and I did nothing to stop it.
</text>
<text start="394.26" dur="5.28">
You know, I&#39;m the kind of person that&#39;s like, &quot;The fast food employee is always right.&quot; Say if I was eating somewhere,
</text>
<text start="399.54" dur="5.12">
And I ask for a chicken salad and they said, &quot;We only have tuna salad.&quot; I&#39;m the kind of person that&#39;s like,
</text>
<text start="404.66" dur="2.16">
Oh, well I guess I&#39;m having the tuna salad then.
</text>
<text start="406.82" dur="6.36">
I think people need to realize that these fast food workers are actually people and not something for you to use to get a free sandwich.
</text>
<text start="413.18" dur="4.86">
I did mean it when I said in the last video that everyone at some point should work in a fast food or retail job.
</text>
<text start="418.04" dur="2.36">
It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s nuts! Ok, we&#39;re done.
</text>
<text start="422.16" dur="4.48">
Look, she&#39;s actually putting six olives on a foot-long. One of them even fell off!
</text>
