<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.12">Hey, this is kinda like a part two video</text><text start="2.18" dur="2">I mean you don&amp;#39;t have to have seen the part one video</text><text start="4.18" dur="2.34">to understand what I 
talk about in this video,</text><text start="6.52" dur="3.06">But I mean if you haven&amp;#39;t watched
part one, uh, you should.</text><text start="9.58" dur="2.38">So I used to work at Subway
and to be honest about</text><text start="11.96" dur="2.48">80% of the customers
were fine.</text><text start="14.44" dur="3.04">Sometimes they would do something
that would just personally annoy me,</text><text start="17.48" dur="2.02">like ask for a
meatball on flatbread.</text><text start="19.5" dur="1.76">So don&amp;#39;t feel 
too bad for me.</text><text start="21.26" dur="1.44">Like, sometimes people
 would ask me:</text><text start="22.7" dur="2.8">&amp;quot;Can I have a turkey
with lettuce, tomatoes--&amp;quot;</text><text start="25.5" dur="1.34">Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Slow down!</text><text start="26.84" dur="1.4">What kind of bread?
Foot-long or six-inch?</text><text start="28.24" dur="1.5">What kind of cheese?
Is it toasted?</text><text start="29.74" dur="1.72">THEN we&amp;#39;ll talk about vegetables!</text><text start="31.46" dur="1.48">And every time someone
brought in a list,</text><text start="32.94" dur="1.74">there would always be
something missing on it.</text><text start="34.68" dur="0.5">Always!</text><text start="35.18" dur="2.6">I never had someone come in
with a complete list.</text><text start="37.78" dur="1.78">I would ask someone,
&amp;quot;What kind of cheese?&amp;quot;</text><text start="39.56" dur="2.4">And they would say,
&amp;quot;Agh, they didn&amp;#39;t specify.&amp;quot;</text><text start="41.96" dur="2.88">Well then, if they didn&amp;#39;t care enough to remember cheese, I guess they&amp;#39;ll get swiss!</text><text start="44.84" dur="4.32">If anyone watching is currently working at a Subway, then feel free to use these tricks.</text><text start="49.16" dur="1.02">if someone asked me,</text><text start="50.18" dur="2.32">&amp;quot;Hmm, what kind of cheese do you recommend?&amp;quot;</text><text start="52.5" dur="1.88">I would ALWAYS say provolone.</text><text start="54.38" dur="2.64">because it&amp;#39;s the easiest cheese to pull apart with gloves on.</text><text start="57.02" dur="4.48">Really, if anyone asked me what I recommended, I would just tell them the easiest thing for me to do.</text><text start="61.5" dur="3.56">But even after I gave my insightful provolone cheese recommendation,</text><text start="65.06" dur="1.6">Sometimes people would still say,</text><text start="66.66" dur="2.04">&amp;quot;Hmm, I&amp;#39;ll take American.&amp;quot;</text><text start="68.7" dur="3.68">why do you even ask me what cheese I would recommend if you&amp;#39;re not gonna take it seriously?!</text><text start="72.38" dur="3.76">Another thing that would annoy me is when people would say the sandwich was &amp;quot;All done&amp;quot;</text><text start="76.14" dur="1.72">But they didn&amp;#39;t put any sauce on it.</text><text start="77.86" dur="3.22">So I would ask, &amp;quot;Any sauce?&amp;quot; and then they would be like, &amp;quot;Oh yeah, Mayonnaise.&amp;quot;</text><text start="81.08" dur="2.64">OH! Why did you tell me it was all done IF IT WASN&amp;#39;T!</text><text start="83.72" dur="3.8">Also, the receipt machine at the store took like seven seconds to print out the receipt.</text><text start="87.52" dur="3.88">So it would be very awkward if I asked someone, &amp;quot;Do you want your receipt?&amp;quot;</text><text start="91.4" dur="1.04">and then they would say, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="92.44" dur="1.64">And then we would just STARE...</text><text start="94.62" dur="1.02">AT EACH OTHER...</text><text start="96.14" dur="1">UNTIL...</text><text start="97.7" dur="0.7">The receipt printed.</text><text start="98.4" dur="2.72">So what I did every time someone swiped their credit card,</text><text start="101.12" dur="1.42">I would just stare off into space,</text><text start="102.54" dur="3.16">And in my head, I would count to five and then I would ask,</text><text start="105.7" dur="1.22">&amp;quot;Do you want your receipt?&amp;quot;</text><text start="106.92" dur="2.6">And by the time they said yes, it was like magic!</text><text start="109.52" dur="2.56">As soon as they said yes, BSSHHH, the receipt printed.</text><text start="112.08" dur="2.12">At Subway, you only work with one other person.</text><text start="114.2" dur="1.48">So if someone got annoyed and said,</text><text start="115.68" dur="1.32">&amp;quot;Lemme talk to your manager.&amp;quot;</text><text start="117" dur="3.38">I would just look at them and go, &amp;quot;Listen, I&amp;#39;ve been here the longest.</text><text start="120.38" dur="4.76">The only other person in this store is a 16-year-old girl, and she technically isn&amp;#39;t old enough to use the toaster.</text><text start="125.14" dur="2.7">So, I&amp;#39;m probably your best bet. I&amp;#39;m the manager.&amp;quot;</text><text start="127.84" dur="4.06">Like, do people think the manager will automatically take their side and give them free stuff?</text><text start="131.9" dur="2.82">YES, actually they do think that because it happens all the time.</text><text start="134.72" dur="4.54">I would consider myself a pretty laid-back Subway employee. I didn&amp;#39;t like to be stingy with people,</text><text start="139.26" dur="2.76">Even though I was disobeying the Subway formula on purpose.</text><text start="142.02" dur="3.88">Oh, you want more than six olives on your foot-long? Pff, sure!</text><text start="145.9" dur="1.6">Here, have a FIFTH slice of cheese!</text><text start="147.5" dur="3.96">A dollar fifty for avocado? Pff, I&amp;#39;ll charge you seventy-five cents buddy!</text><text start="151.46" dur="4.62">I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be saying these things, you know. In case this whole YouTube thing flops and I need a job.</text><text start="156.08" dur="4.1">So I wasn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;strict&amp;quot; on the rules. You know those fast food workers who are strict,</text><text start="160.18" dur="2.62">&amp;quot;No! We won&amp;#39;t serve breakfast at 10:02! Get out!&amp;quot;</text><text start="162.8" dur="3.08">But being pretty laid back still didn&amp;#39;t stop people from being annoying.</text><text start="165.88" dur="3.7">So this one person comes in and asks for two, foot-long, pastrami sandwiches.</text><text start="169.58" dur="4.28">And pastrami is our most expensive sandwich. It&amp;#39;s about $10 for a foot-long.</text><text start="173.86" dur="6.7">And guys, the pastrami is super good, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay for it. I mean it&amp;#39;s good, yeah, but I&amp;#39;m not paying $10 for a foot-long.</text><text start="180.56" dur="4.72">It&amp;#39;s not worth it. So this guy, I make his two sandwiches. I ring them up and I say, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;ll be $20.&amp;quot;</text><text start="185.28" dur="4.68">And I guess he didn&amp;#39;t look at the price of the sandwich on the menu, or he thought we still did the $5 foot-longs,</text><text start="189.96" dur="2.04">because he said to me, &amp;quot;I ain&amp;#39;t paying for that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="192" dur="1.84">And this is when I was just starting out!</text><text start="193.84" dur="4.06">I only had like, a week of experience, and after he said that, I responded,</text><text start="197.9" dur="3.78">&amp;quot;Well, shoot, I guess you&amp;#39;re not paying for it, I didn&amp;#39;t know people could do that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="201.68" dur="6.2">&amp;quot;Hey, I want this!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Alright, that&amp;#39;s $20&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Nah.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot; No I want it, I&amp;#39;m just not paying for it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="207.88" dur="6.36">Ok no, but actually we did come up with a compromise. He told me he had $12, so he ended up paying for one of the sandwiches,</text><text start="214.24" dur="2.72">And I got to eat the other one. So it all worked out.</text><text start="216.96" dur="5.4">So one time I was making a sandwich for a guy with a very heavy accent and he asks for onions on the side.</text><text start="222.36" dur="3.28">No big deal! We had Sooubway put vegetables in little cups all the time.</text><text start="225.64" dur="4.62">I actually got a soup cup, because the on the side cups are teeny-tiny and I started doing my thing.</text><text start="230.26" dur="8.04">But then he says, &amp;quot;No! On the side.&amp;quot; and I think, &amp;quot; Oh! He&amp;#39;s getting a foot-long! He probably wants onions on half of it, but not the other.</text><text start="238.3" dur="5.26">So I start putting onions on half the sub, but then again he says, &amp;quot;No! On the side!&amp;quot;</text><text start="243.56" dur="4.88">At this point, I don&amp;#39;t know what this guy wants. So I ask him, &amp;quot;On the side of what?&amp;quot; and then he screams,</text><text start="248.44" dur="0.9">O N I O N S</text><text start="249.34" dur="1.9">And I never figured out what he was trying to say.</text><text start="251.24" dur="5.54">This one old gentleman asks for sauce to be put on his vegetables, and normally we put it on top of the sandwich with the meat.</text><text start="256.78" dur="4.6">And I didn&amp;#39;t know if I heard him correctly because I put the sauce on and closed the sandwich.</text><text start="261.38" dur="2.14">So your sauce would&amp;#39;ve been in the same place either way!</text><text start="263.52" dur="2.86">One time, this woman tipped me and Correy $40.</text><text start="266.38" dur="3.34">She wasn&amp;#39;t annoying. I just wanted to sprinkle in some good customer stories.</text><text start="269.72" dur="6.32">Ok one time, this, uh, Native American person came in and, I don&amp;#39;t know if mentioning that was important to the story...</text><text start="276.06" dur="5.28">He comes in and asks for five foot-long Tunas. Ok Tyler, just me and you lets do this!</text><text start="281.34" dur="3.34">and then when we&amp;#39;re all finished, we ring them up and we say, &amp;quot;Anything else?&amp;quot;</text><text start="284.68" dur="4.3">and he says, &amp;quot;seven meatballs&amp;quot; What!? He wanted seven more sandwiches!</text><text start="288.98" dur="6.02">But James, you&amp;#39;re Sooubway! You&amp;#39;re supposed to make people sandwiches regardless of how many they ask for.</text><text start="295" dur="2.4">Yeah I know, but the guy could&amp;#39;ve handled it differently.</text><text start="297.4" dur="4.68">Normally for a platter, you have to call in at least an hour ahead, and that&amp;#39;s only five foot-longs.</text><text start="302.08" dur="5.46">This guy could&amp;#39;ve called ahead and said, &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m getting twelve sandwiches so just, prepare yourselves... mentally.&amp;quot;</text><text start="307.54" dur="5.08">I mean we had so many customers waiting in line. No, we didn&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s a lie, it was only him. But still!</text><text start="312.62" dur="3.7">This one woman, I was making her sandwich and for vegetables, she asked for extra lettuce.</text><text start="316.82" dur="5.84">So I put on a big handful, but then she asks for more. So I put more on, &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; I sprinkle some on</text><text start="322.84" dur="0.84">M O R E!</text><text start="323.68" dur="6.22">&amp;quot;Uh, I won&amp;#39;t be able to close the sandwich with any more lettuce.&amp;quot; and she says, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s fine.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Alright, extra lettuce it is.&amp;quot;</text><text start="329.9" dur="3.3">So I ended up giving her an open sandwich with a mountain of lettuce.</text><text start="333.2" dur="1.86">You know we do salads, right?</text><text start="335.06" dur="5.72">When I was little, I always thought if I was working at a store and someone tried to rob me, I wouldn&amp;#39;t give them any money.</text><text start="340.78" dur="5.18">But now it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Pshh, I ain&amp;#39;t risking my life for Sooubway! Here take the cash register!&amp;quot;</text><text start="345.96" dur="4.72">So thankfully I&amp;#39;ve never had someone pull a gun on me, but I have caught people stealing from us.</text><text start="350.68" dur="3.72">I was making someone&amp;#39;s sandwich and this one kid asks for just a water cup.</text><text start="354.4" dur="5.12">So I gave it to him. So I go back to making a sandwich and I just hear the fuzzy soda sounds being dispensed,</text><text start="359.52" dur="4.36">And I look over, and the kid is putting soda in the cup! HE DIDN&amp;#39;T EVEN TRY TO HIDE IT!</text><text start="363.88" dur="3.88">When I put soda in a water cup I at least wait for the employees to go in the back.</text><text start="367.76" dur="3.5">But, I didn&amp;#39;t even say anything. I was just like, &amp;quot;Alright, man.&amp;quot;</text><text start="371.26" dur="4.62">This guy, I totally saw him take a bag of chips and he hid it under the counter so I couldn&amp;#39;t see.</text><text start="375.88" dur="4.36">So when I rang up his sandwich I asked, &amp;quot;Anything else?&amp;quot; and he said, &amp;quot;Nope.&amp;quot;</text><text start="380.24" dur="4.9">Alright, whatever. Ok, last story. I was in the back playing some Clash of Clans,</text><text start="385.14" dur="4.18">And we have a computer that shows what the cameras see, and I see this woman who was eating there,</text><text start="389.32" dur="4.94">She reached over the counter and took three large cups and I did nothing to stop it.</text><text start="394.26" dur="5.28">You know, I&amp;#39;m the kind of person that&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;The fast food employee is always right.&amp;quot; Say if I was eating somewhere,</text><text start="399.54" dur="5.12">And I ask for a chicken salad and they said, &amp;quot;We only have tuna salad.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m the kind of person that&amp;#39;s like,</text><text start="404.66" dur="2.16">Oh, well I guess I&amp;#39;m having the tuna salad then.</text><text start="406.82" dur="6.36">I think people need to realize that these fast food workers are actually people and not something for you to use to get a free sandwich.</text><text start="413.18" dur="4.86">I did mean it when I said in the last video that everyone at some point should work in a fast food or retail job.</text><text start="418.04" dur="2.36">It&amp;#39;s  it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s nuts! Ok, we&amp;#39;re done.</text><text start="422.16" dur="4.48">Look, she&amp;#39;s actually putting six olives on a foot-long. One of them even fell off!</text></transcript>
